Please [submit problematic words](https://github.com/BoboTiG/reader-dict-tracker/issues/new?template=bug-report.md) for the team to look at here. We'd like to use the "thumbs up" reaction as an upvote to track priority from the community, so to "+1" an issue please add a thumbs up reaction to it.

Issues are also automatically created when using the "Quick Feedback" feature from the website, no need to have a GitHub account for that.

Remember to be kind to everyone here - we all love those dictionaries, and we're all trying to make them the best possible.

Thank you!
